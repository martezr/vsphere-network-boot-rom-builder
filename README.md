# vsphere-network-boot-rom-builder
Automation to build a custom VMware vSphere network boot rom

Build custom roms by running the rombuilder.sh script which will create the Docker image and run the rom builder container.

```
./rombuilder.sh
```

Once the rom builder has finished the boot roms will be in the bins directory in the current directory.
